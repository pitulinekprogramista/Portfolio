  I bought a drone and instantly fell in love with it. I spent all my savings,
  but it was totally worth it. Flying a drone had always been my dream, and now
  I’m living it. So far, I’ve flown 1,163 km, clocking 83 hours of non-stop
  flight time and completing around 700 flights. It’s been an incredible
  journey, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
