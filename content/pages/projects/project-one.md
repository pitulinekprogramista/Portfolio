  I got myself a 3D printer, the Ender 3 V2, and while it’s awesome, it’s also a
  total grind. You’ve got to put in some serious effort to get a good print.
  Designing, slicing, calibrating temperatures, and working with different types
  of filaments—from PLA to PET-G and even ABS—it’s a whole process. But when it
  finally comes together, the results are worth the hustle.
