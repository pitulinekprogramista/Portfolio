  Next I bought a drone and instantly fell in love with it. I spent all my
  savings, but it was totally worth it. Flying a drone had always been my dream,
  and now I’m living it. So far, I’ve flown 1,163 km, clocking 83 hours of
  non-stop flight time and completing around 700 flights. It’s been an
  incredible journey, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
